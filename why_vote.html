		It may sometimes seem like voting is not worthwhile but in fact, making an informed choice regarding your local candidates is vital to ensure you have done your best to put people in power who share your goals for society. It is especially important that we as young vote because it has been shown that those who vote tend be older, wealthier and supporters of traditional parties. It is no surprise then that their interests are looked after by successive governments. However, when young people turn up to vote en masse, it can change the country for the better as we saw with last year’s marriage referendum.

If you are not happy with how politicians have run the country recently, the solution is not to ignore them by not voting at all. This just gives more power to those that put elected those politicians in the first place.The solution is to find credible candidates that offer an alternative.

If young people show their determination to turn up to vote in the upcoming general election, politicians will have no choice but to listen to our concerns about Irish society. While the Union of Students of Ireland has done a fantastic job at registering students to vote, not all young people are students and we believe all young people deserve to have their voice heard in this election campaign.

On the other hand, if  young people turning out well below other groups, politicians will pay less attention to what young people want to see happen in society. In this way who votes has a powerful impact on public policy, government and ultimately the society we live in.

<br><p style="text-align:left">
		What do Ireland and Malta have in common? Well not the weather! They both are the only European countries to use the voting system PR-STV. Estonia introduced it briefly in the early nineties, but it was deemed too complicated for the people to manage, and was promptly scrapped.
<br><br>

How complicated is it really?<br><br><br>

Here is a brief breakdown of the PR-STV voting system, and how people think it influences Irish politics:
<br><br>

<b>What does PR-STV mean?</b><br><br>
PR-STV stands for Proportional representation by Single-transferrable vote.
<br><br>
The PR part means that seats are won proportionally.
<br><br>
Simply put, if 30% of the people voting vote for a party, that party will get roughly 30% of seats. PR voting systems are quite popular around Europe, countries like the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, Denmark and the Czech Republic all use a form of PR.
<br><br>

<b>Ireland uses a form of PR called Single Transferrable Vote (or STV!).</b>
<br><br>

In this type of electoral system, voters rank each candidate on the ticket in order of preference. The voter can number each candidate from 1 to 12, based on whichever they like the best. STV is unique because unlike its electoral cousin, the list system, you can vote across party lines. The voter can place a number one in the box beside Candidate A from Fine Gael, then put a 2 in the box for Candidate X from Sinn Fein, then a 3 in the box for Candidate Z who is an Independent and so on.

<br><br>
<b>Why bother putting down all your preferences?</b>
<br><br>
Well one of the things that scholars think is so advantageous about STV, is that no vote is wasted. During the count of the votes, as candidates are elected or eliminated, surplus votes that would otherwise be wasted are transferred to other candidates.
<br><br>

<b>So that’s how it works. Simple right? Well we might still put it to the test with this example.</b>
<br><br>
You walk into the voting booth with your voting ballot. You place a 1 in the box beside Tom Cruise from Fianna Fail because he is excellent and you want him to win a seat in your constituency. Next you put a number 2 in the box beside Angelina Jolie who is running as an independent. What does this mean?
<br><br>
The people counting the votes will collect all the ballot papers where Tom Cruise is number 1 and count them. To be elected, Tom Cruise needs a certain number of No. 1 votes. If he gets that number, he gets elected. But maybe there are loads of extra No. 1 votes he doesn’t need anymore. The ballot papers will be looked at again, and the votes will be re-divided between the No. 2s. Your vote will be given to Angelia Jolie, because you gave her a No. 2.
<br><br>
In another option where votes are re-distributed, Tom Cruise gets very few voters giving him their No. 1. He doesn’t meet the threshold- the number he needs to stay in the race, and he is excluded from the count. Instead of all those votes being wasted, the votes are transferred to the person who got your second preference – Angelina Jolie.
<br><br>
This goes on and on and on, down third and fourth preferences if need be, until the available seats are filled and the candidates Elected. This entire process means it’s quite hard to get elected on 1st votes alone, you also need other people’s 2nd and 3rd preferences – called ‘transfers’. This is why you sometimes see election posters with the candidate urging people to give their 2nd preference to a ‘running mate’, usually someone from the same party.
<br><br>

<b>The rules of the game shape the game, and this is very much true for electoral systems.</b>
<br><br>
Countless books and articles have been written about the likely impact PRSTV has on Irish politics. Like everything, these ideas can be debated and re-debated, but there are a few impacts most people agree our electoral system has on Irish politics.
<ol style="text-align:left">
	<li	>The Dail has quite a low threshold compared to other countries (that is, the number of votes a candidate needs to get elected). This, with the Proportional part of the PR-STV, means that it is easier for smaller parties to get seats. This leads to a lot of coalition governments, where parties band together to get enough a majority to make a government.</li>
  <li>If we glance across at the UK, their voting system is a ‘first past the post’ system, which favour bigger parties and single-party government. Many people argue the electoral system there is a big reason as to why the race for government is usually between the two big parties; the Conservatives and Labour.</li>
  <li>The transfers of 2nd, 3rd and so on preferences can give a pretty good indication of what parties people are voting for. In our last general election in 2011, there were a lot of transfers between Fine Gael and Labour, which gave the impression that Irish people preferred those parties to be in government together.</li>
  <li>Because Ireland has that unique quirk where you vote for candidates, rather than parties, we have quite a large number of Independents in our parliament, much more than is usual in the rest of Europe. The fact that our constituencies are based geographically mean that there is a strong regional voice in the Dail. The argument goes on whether this leads to an increased focus on local constituencies rather than the state as a whole, and other forms of ‘parish pump politics’ where politicians are focused on their own constituency for votes. Others argue that this is also a negative effect of the number of Independents, who arguably have no real incentive to sacrifice their constituencies’ interests for the best interest of the entire state.</li>
</ol>

<br><p style="text-align:left">Most agree that PR-STV offers a lot of choice to voters. Like any part of the political system, it is worth knowing a bit about how it works, because electoral systems in any country has such a big impact on how politics works there. Ireland has an unusual electoral system, and over the years there has been the odd attempt to change to it a completely different one. But while other countries have dropped it, it remains strong in Ireland, and has definitely made an impact on Irish political culture.</p>
